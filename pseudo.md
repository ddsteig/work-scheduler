A daily planner used to create a schedule.

When I open the planner:
    Current day & time are displayed at top of calendar.
    Hourly timeblocks are presented for a 24-hour day.
        For time, starting at midnight:
            Create a div,
            Give the div a id or class,
            Append div to html,
    Military time format.

Timeblocks are color coded by:
    If time is less than currentTime, the Past timeblock is Grey.
    If time is equal to  currentTime, the Present timeblock is Green.
    If time is greater than currentTime, the Future timeblock is Blue.

When I click the timeblock:
    I can input text,
        I can click an icon to save text to local storage.
